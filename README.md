# Summary

The OSSU cohort program enables students of any OSSU curriculum to study together, learn from each other, and keep each other accountable. It was developed to help those who want to gain *well-rounded* fundamentals in their respective course, but don't want to do it without the help of others.

We believe in collaboration and community, and cohorts are designed to encourage this. 

[You can read more about our mission here.](https://github.com/ossu/help/blob/master/MISSION.md)

# Joining A Cohort

We want joining a cohort to be as easy as possible. 

If there is a class you are about to start, we encourage you to join a cohort that already exists. You can take a look at our (Github issues)[https://github.com/ossu/cohorts/issues] to see if there are any upcoming cohorts that will be starting soon. You can also take a look through our Github repo to find a cohort that has already started.

If there is a particular class you are starting and you have not found an existing cohort, then you can use our (cohort generator)[https://ossu.github.io/cohorts/cohort-generator/index.html] to create a new Github issue, which will allow students to join you in your journey to educational development.
